The Golden Hour is a web application that provides users with information about the golden hour, a period of time just after sunrise or just before sunset when the light is infused with red and gold tones. Users can search for the golden hour time for a specific location and receive a live countdown until the golden hour begins.

Getting Started
To get started with The Golden Hour, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The application is designed to work on modern web browsers and does not require any additional installations or dependencies.

Usage
Once the application is loaded, users can enter a location in the search bar and click the Search button. The application will then retrieve the location's coordinates and use them to calculate the golden hour time for that location. The application will display the golden hour time and a live countdown until the golden hour begins. If the golden hour has already passed, the application will inform the user and display a message indicating when the next golden hour will occur.

Technologies Used
The Golden Hour is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application uses the geocode.maps.co API to retrieve the location's coordinates and the api.sunrisesunset.io API to calculate the golden hour time for that location.

Contributions
The Golden Hour is an open-source project and contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
